Welcome to my personal website! Couple notes:

- Built in React with Typescript
- Has CD setup through GitHub Actions, so just need to deploy changes to main
- Includes fun donut animation in the 404 page (credit: https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html for the inspiration and base code--ported to Typescript)

Featured Dependencies:
- [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) for routing
- [hamburger-react](https://github.com/cyntler/hamburger-react) for the menu button
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) for some base UI components
- [react-markdown](https://remarkjs.github.io/react-markdown/) for easier About page text formatting
